# TODO

## Completed
- [X] Basic game loading
- [X] Stylization and animations
- [X] Update icons to SVGs (SVGs render as shapes instead of images, so they will ALWAYS be high quality)
- [X] Integrate Ruffle (Adobe Flash emulator, will not be separate)
- [X] Add "about" section
- [X] Add drag to drop functionality for ROMs
- [X] Add PWA (so you can install the site as an app)

## In Progress
- [ ] Migrate to GitHub Pages

## Not started


**First major update:** THEMES and backgrounds (meaning you will be able to choose background style + color)
